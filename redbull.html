      <p class="image-description">Concept images designed to determine possible creative branding opportunities for products and services. Each piece combines design concerns with messaging goals to envision how a brand might look in unique contexts—be it through sponsorship of events, renaming of products, or experiential campaign promotion imagery.</p>
      <p class="image-description">This concept was created using a combination of Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom to explore dynamic branding within the esports space. Photoshop was used to design and arrange key elements, such as the Red Bull can, custom banners, and event branding, while incorporating lighting, shadows, and layered effects to build depth and cohesion. Lightroom was then used in the post-processing stage to enhance the overall tone and atmosphere—balancing contrast, color, and clarity to create a bold, high-energy visual that aligns with both the Red Bull and League of Legends Worlds aesthetics.</p>
