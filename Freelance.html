      <p class="image-description">As a freelance graphic designer with over seven years of experience, I’ve worked closely with gaming content creators to craft custom visuals that elevate their personal branding. This section showcases a selection of banners designed for streamers, Youtubers, and online personalities. My workflow primarily involves Adobe Photoshop for compositing, retouching, and layout design, Adobe Lightroom for colour correction and tonal adjustments, and Cinema 4D for creating and integrating 3D elements when needed. Such as stylized text, lighting effects, or environmental assets. I focus on delivering high-impact designs that are both visually polished and technically optimized for digital platforms, blending artistic direction with a deep understanding of the tools that bring these ideas to life.  </p>
